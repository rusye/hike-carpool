# Hike Carpool

Hike Carpool is a blog dedicated to helping hikers find other hikers that have room in their car's when they are going hiking or even share when they have room in their own cars.

## Motivation

When ever I want to go hiking I usually have open seats in my car, and am always open to the idea of meeting new people on hikes.

## Description

I want to go hike a particular mountain and I have open spots in my car, I would go on the site input the hike name the number of seats available in the car and the details about the hike.  After users have contacted me I could go back in and adjust the amount of open seats I have in my car and maybe even change the whole hike description if there is bad weather.
